Android anti screen capture anti malware

Needs a transparent layer that is digitized to distort layer displaying the actual rendering of the OS as a form of protection from app screen shot
Display 0:0 with android root

Similar to anti screen shot but protecting video out at all times as a double video layer


Think transparent RGB layer over actual video out almost like nested layers
Except transparent layer does distortion at the pixel or kernel level
Or maybe blocking kernel call outside of any screen shot using dtrace
When kernel calls screen capture even with type of DEX address to save to file as video device
Since there must be a call to save to file or similar pipe to file from /dev/video
As a form of capture 

To block , to find kernel call, when dev video is out of bounds
Of screenshot capture


Or the other possibility of 

Like a trigger to block when dev video is called using a listener for kernel call at kernel or userspace level when out of bounds of permission of device allow for screenshot
